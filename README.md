## Symbols
### Comparisons
- `:=`,`≡` "Equal by definition"

### Logic
- `∴` "Therefore"
- `∋`,`s.t.` "Such that" ("under the condition that")
- `⇒` "Implies" ("raining ⇒ pouring" means "if it’s raining, then it’s pouring")
- `⇐⇒`,`iff` "If and only if" ("thunder iff lightening" means thunder and lightening imply eachother)
- `∀` "For all" (universal quantifier)
- `∃` "There exists" (existential quantifier)
- `􏰀`,`QED` "End of logical statement"

### Sets
- `⊂` "Is included in" ("this set is a subset of")
- `⊃` "Includes" ("this set has as a subset")
- `∈` "Is in" ("is an element of")
- `∪` "Union" ("take the elements that are in either set"
