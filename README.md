Guide to understanding the mathematical and probabilistic notations in machine learning papers

## Symbols
### Comparisons
- `:=` "Is assigned as" (e.g. $x := y$ means $y$ is assigned to $x$)
- `=:` "Is defined to be equal to" (e.g. $x =: y$ means $x$ is defined to be $y$)
- `~` "Follows the distribution" (e.g. $X \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ means $X$ follows a normal distribution)

### Logic
- `∴` "Therefore"
- `∋`,`s.t.` "Such that" ("under the condition that")
- `⇒` "Implies" (e.g. "raining ⇒ pouring" means "if it’s raining, then it’s pouring")
- `⇐⇒`,`iff` "If and only if" (e.g. "thunder iff lightening" means thunder and lightening imply eachother)
- `∀` "For all" (universal quantifier)
- `∃` "There exists" (existential quantifier)
- `􏰀`,`QED` "End of logical statement"

### Sets
- `⊂` "Is included in" ("this set is a subset of")
- `⊃` "Includes" ("this set has as a subset")
- `∈` "Is in" ("is an element of")
- `∪` "Union" ("take the elements that are in either set"
- `∩` "Intersection" ("take the elements that the two sets have in common")
- `∅` "Null set" ("the set without any elements in it")

## Expressions
- Normal or Gaussian distribution: $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^{2})$
